## Chapter 1: The Tar Pit
- Working on large systems is like fighting against quicksand; the more you try to move forward, the more stuck you get.
- It’s not one big issue that causes delays, but a combination of many small, interacting problems.
- Even skilled programmers get caught off guard by how much complexity big projects bring.
- Moving from a simple program to a full system is much harder than expected, and costs multiply fast.
- Programmers enjoy the creative challenge, but the constant need for perfection can be overwhelming.
- Even a tiny error can break everything, making debugging a mental marathon.
- Adding more people usually slows down the project because the need for communication grows too much.

## Chapter 2: The Mythical Man-Month
- There’s a big myth that adding more people speeds up a project, but it often makes things worse.
- Brooks’s Law: "Adding manpower to a late project makes it later." 
- Programmers are usually too optimistic about timelines, always thinking they’re almost done.
- Adding more people increases the time needed for communication, not just coding.
- Testing always takes more time than expected, but no one ever plans for that properly.
- The more people you add, the harder it gets to coordinate everything, which cancels out the benefit.
- Instead of solving the problem, throwing more hands at it just creates new challenges to manage.
